# Calculator
test project

This is my 1st project as a beginner.<br />
1Tthere has to some number before performing any operation like you can not click any operation like (+,-,*,/) at the start it will give error like operation performed is not valid ex. you can do like this 4+4, 44+8, 123+456 you canot do like this...+++4, 44++, 4+- NOTE: after applying any action you cant apply same or diffrent operation again.
2. You can see the history of action you perforemed by clicking on history button.<br />

this is a simple application so you just need to download the file and open .html file to run the application.
